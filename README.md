# Ticket Tracker

This is a personal project to create a internal company tool I call Ticket Desk. It maintains a running active ticket thread where anyone within the company can submit a ticket with a 1-5 priority level and a custom comment.

Once a user is registered they will be able to pull tickets from the active board and put them in their que. 
An aditional feature is a project based "Trello" like board where a user can take tickets put them in working, compleated, and delete, all by mouse or finger click and drag.
